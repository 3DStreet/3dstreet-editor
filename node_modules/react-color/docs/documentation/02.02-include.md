Import a color picker from `react-color` at the top of a component and then use it in the render function:
```
import React from 'react';
import { SketchPicker } from 'react-color';

class Component extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return <SketchPicker />;
  }
}
```
You can import `ChromePicker` `CompactPicker` `MaterialPicker` `PhotoshopPicker` `SketchPicker` `SliderPicker` `SwatchesPicker` respectively.
