**inline-style-prefix-all** is a **tiny** *(3.3kb gzipped)* static javascript **Autoprefixer** for inline style objects. It uses data from [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/) to get all properties that require a prefix up to a given browser version.<br>
It was extracted from [inline-style-prefixer](https://github.com/rofrischmann/inline-style-prefixer). Check that repository for detailed information on which properties are supported, which special plugins are used and other stuff.
> You could also use [inline-style-prefixer](https://github.com/rofrischmann/inline-style-prefixer) completely as it uses **prefix-all** as a fallback, but this repository has reduced file size.

# Browser Scope
It will **only** add prefixes if a property still needs them in one of the following browser versions.<br>
This means *e.g. `border-radius`* will not be prefixed at all.<br>
For legacy support check [custom build](#custom-build--legacy-support).
* Chrome: 30+
* Safari: 6+
* Firefox: 25+
* Opera: 13+
* IE: 9+
* Edge 12+
* iOS: 6+
* Android: 4+
* IE mobile: 9+
* Opera mini: 5+
* Android UC: 9+
* Android Chrome: 30+

# Usage
```bash
npm install inline-style-prefix-all --save
```
```javascript
import prefixAll from 'inline-style-prefix-all'

const styles = {
  transition: '200ms all linear',
  boxSizing: 'border-box',
  display: 'flex',
  color: 'blue'
}

const prefixedStyles = prefixAll(styles)

// prefixedStyles === output
const output = {
  WebkitTransition: '200ms all linear',
  // Firefox dropped prefixed transition with version 16
  // IE never supported prefixed transitions
  transition: '200ms all linear',
  MozBoxSizing: 'border-box',
  // Firefox up to version 28 needs a prefix
  // Others dropped prefixes out of scope
  boxSizing: 'border-box',
  // Fallback/prefixed values get grouped in arrays
  display: ['-webkit-box', '-moz-box', '-ms-flexbox', '-webkit-flex', 'flex']
  color: 'blue'
}
```

# Custom Build & Legacy Support
You may have to create a custom build if you need older browser versions. Just modify the [config.js](config.js) file which includes all the browser version specifications.
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
